\subsection*{C. Fringe Benefits}

\subsection*{E. Travel}
PI Person One, PI Person Two, and the PhD student plan to attend vacations in small-town America. We request the following travel funds to cover airfare, per diem, and booze.

\subsection*{E. Participant Support Costs}
There are no participant support costs associated with this project.

\subsection*{G. Other Direct Costs}
We plan to publish the results of our study in Years 2 and 3. We project that results will be verifiable and provide data that will produce information which will be disseminated through conferences where people waste time hearing themselves talk and publication in obscure journals that no one actually reads. A desktop computer will be used to conduct this work and to read TMZ when we are bored. Additionally, we anticipate the need for external local disk storage, software licenses, and repair fees for existing workstations. We also are requesting funds in each project year to support miscellaneous costs associated with the outreach activities, such as Snapchat filters.  These costs may include: basic supplies (notebooks, clipboards, etc.) and subscriptions to HBO Now and Showtime Anytime.

\subsection*{H. Indirect Costs}

\noindent The modified total direct cost for each year was multiplied by the corresponding negotiated overhead rate. The indirect costs are summarized below.
